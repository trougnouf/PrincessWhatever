* Bedroom *
- Click anywhere to get out of bed.
(current goal is to defeat Magikoi who is terrorizing princess whatever)
- Take potted plant
- Throw potted plant at Magikoi (it's super effective!). MagikoiHealthy turns into MagikoiPotted and rips the princess' arm off.
- Take arm.

* Kitchen *
- Take jackhammer
- Take mail (hero actually looks through the spam and finds a physical nigerian scam letter)
- Take pan (use/look at one of the cabinets)
- Take tongs (use/look at one of the drawers)

* Parking *
- Take Jumper Cables
- Give arm to giant chicken. "[chicken]: Thank you hero! As a token of my appreciation I will fly you anywhere."
	from now on: T2chicken = "[chicken]: Where may I take you? [home][grocery store][bank]"

* Room *
- Use jackhammer with AC outlet
- Use jumper cables with AC outlet dangling wires
(Magikoi becomes dead. Princess tells hero that she is dying and needs bacon to survive)

(if hero goes to grocery store, clerk won't let hero leave without paying
if hero goes to bank, they will laugh at hero and not give money out)

* Bank *
- Hand over the nigerian scam to teller (teller is impressed)
- Talk to teller, she will now open a line of credit and give hero a credit card

* Grocery store back *
- Get bacon
* Grocery store front *
- Use credit card on terminal

* Kitchen *
- Put pan on stovetop
- Use stovetop control (turn on)
- Put pack of bacon on pan
- Use stovetop control (turn off) -> "[environment icon]: Thank you."
- Use tongs on bacon (without tongs, hero will complain that he got burned.)
	- bacon state will depend on # of time bacon was on stovetop while it was turned on.
	- pack of bacon remains in the inventory (player can start over. If any kind of cooked bacon is in the inventory, hero complains that "[hero]: And waste this perfectly good slice of bacon? I think not. Princess whatever would surely disapprove."

* Bedroom *
- Give bacon to princess
- alternatively hero can give bacon to the chicken (-> "[chicken icon]: Thank you.") and start over
	- soggy bacon (<50s) = princess dumps hero (-> "[princess]: This is not crispy! I am leaving you.") (princess fades out, cat fades in). The end
	- good bacon (50-60s) = princess is happy. The end
	- burned bacon (>60s) = (-> "[princess icon]: This burned bacon gave me cancer. Goodbye.") (princess turns into dead princess, cat fades in). The end
